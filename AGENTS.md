# howhard contributor instructions

Keep this file limited to repository-wide guardrails. Follow the canonical contracts and
procedures listed in [docs/index.md](docs/index.md). These guardrails adopt AGCoord's
contributor workflow for this repository.

- Track every code, test, documentation, or packaging change with a descriptive issue.
  Pair every issue number with a sentence explaining the work it tracks. Do not file an
  issue solely for machine-local installation, deployment, configuration, service
  lifecycle, or other operator state; create one only when that work also requires a
  repository change or the user explicitly requests an issue.
- Develop and validate only in an issue-specific Git worktree branched from `main`.
  Preserve unrelated work and do not develop in the primary checkout.
- Verify behavior at public boundaries. Start bug fixes with a failing behavioral test;
  accompany runtime changes with focused tests, affected canonical documentation, and a
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry when the change is user-facing.
- A documentation-only change needs no tests or AGCoord gate. It qualifies only when every
  changed path is `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Markdown below `docs/`, or a
  `.png` or `.svg` image below `docs/assets/` whose provenance is recorded in
  `docs/assets/README.md`. Verify the exact pull-request file list and diff, then merge it
  through the forge; the issue, worktree, branch, pull-request, and no-direct-target-push
  rules still apply.
- Tests own and stop every process, repository, and temporary state they create.
  Never inspect or clean another agent's state.
- Keep the package independent of a parent application or sibling checkout.
  Put project-specific assumptions in optional configuration; the ordinary workflow
  must work without configuration or statistical parameter tuning.
- For every other change after bootstrap, route checks and publication through the local
  coordinator, declare every scarce resource, and never submit coordinated work from an
  admitted job. Gate and publish through one `agc land` request; never bypass or separate
  its verdict from publication.
- Never upload a howhard distribution to PyPI unless the user explicitly requests it.
  Permission to implement, test, commit, push, merge, tag, or create a GitHub release
  does not authorize an upload.
- End changed work with the four-part [session handoff](docs/session_handoff_format.md);
  answer read-only questions directly without an empty handoff shell.
- Follow the [contributor workflow](docs/contributing.md) for commands, bootstrap,
  recovery, and cleanup. The [model and storage contracts](docs/reference.md) and
  [release guide](docs/releasing.md) define the corresponding component contracts.
